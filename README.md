This is a simple 2D game similar to *The 7th Guest: Infection* from 1997, written with the LÖVE 2D game engine and Lua as a school assignment.

## Game Rules

You (blue tile) have to fight against the AI (red tiles).  
Your goal is to conquer the most tiles.

---

## Controls

You can either:  
- **Expand a tile** by selecting a blue tile first, then selecting a neighbouring empty tile.  
- **Jump a tile** by selecting a blue tile first, then selecting an empty tile that’s two spaces away from it.

## Mechanics

When your tile touches an enemy tile, you conquer that enemy tile — and vice versa.
